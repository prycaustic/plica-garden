VERY simple web front-end for notes / images / other media. 

Point it to a content folder and each folder within that will become a page which lists either notes or moodboards depending on the type of files within it.
This is still a work in progress.

Inspired by this similar project called [Folderbase](https://rafichaudhury.com/site/blog/Folderbase)
