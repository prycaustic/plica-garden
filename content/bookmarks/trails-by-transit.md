Escaping downtown Chicago to get to the great outdoors doesn’t require an expensive plane ticket — or even a car.

Urbanites can use public transportation to do a deep dive into nature, relying on buses, trains and the “L” to whisk them to forest-engulfed trails and other recreational destinations that feel a world away from the grind of city life.

Here are four ways to get your outdoor fix, and all it takes is a small fare to get you there.

#### Indiana Dunes National Park

_Via South Shore Line_

The country’s newest national park is right in Chicago’s backyard. [Indiana Dunes National Park](https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm), which claimed its spot as the nation’s 61st national park in February, clings to 15 miles of the southern shore of Lake Michigan. It boasts eight beaches, camp sites and 14 trail systems that encompass 50 miles of hiking paths over its famed sand dunes and through wetlands, prairies and forests.

The park is a bird-lover’s bonanza. More than [350 species](http://www.indianadunes.com/birding-tour/), including blue herons, sandhill cranes, Nashville warblers, and red-tailed hawks, migrate through its [Great Marsh](https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/great-marsh.htm) each year. The annual [Indiana Dunes Birding Festival](https://indunesbirdingfestival.com/) takes place May 16-19.

Bikes come in handy for exploring the 15,000-acre array of wildlife, landscapes and shoreline. There’s no extra charge to bring your own set of wheels on the [South Shore Line](https://www.mysouthshoreline.com/); the commuter rail line that runs between downtown’s [Millennium Station](https://www.mysouthshoreline.com/tickets/maps-stations) and Indiana’s South Bend International Airport allows [bikes on designated trains from April through October](https://www.mysouthshoreline.com/plan-your-trip/bikes-on-trains).

Pedal along 10 flat miles of crushed limestone on the [Calumet Trail](https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/calumet.htm) that follows the South Shore Railroad tracks and links to other routes. Almost [40 miles of bike trails](https://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/biking.htm) span the length of the park.

When it’s time to get off the bike and hike, put your quads to the test at the adjacent [Indiana Dunes State Park](https://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/2980.htm) with the so-called [3 Dune Challenge](http://www.indianadunes.com/3dc/). The 1.5-mile loop entails climbing a cumulative 552 feet to the peaks of Mount Jackson (elevation 176 feet), Mount Holden (184 feet), and Mount Tom (192 feet).

**Directions:** From Millennium Station, take the South Shore Line to Dune Park Station. The train trip typically takes a little under 90 minutes.

#### Des Plaines River Trail

_Via the CTA Blue Line_

Reaching almost as far north as the Wisconsin border, the roughly 60-mile [Des Plaines River Trail](http://fpdcc.com/downloads/maps/trails/english/FPCC-Des-Plaines-Trail-Map-10-15.pdf) gives hikers, bikers and trail runners a rugged outdoor experience on par with what you’d find hundreds of miles away in the forests of the Northwoods and western Michigan.

The trail — one of the longest in Cook and Lake counties’ forest preserve districts — switches between root-covered and rocky dirt pathway, smooth asphalt and crushed limestone. Passing through oak, hickory and maple woodlands, it meanders parallel to its namesake Des Plaines River.

In the summer, the tree canopy grows so thick, the sun has a hard time reaching the forest floor, providing a shady haven from the heat. The trail stitches together a dozen different forest preserves from its northern end in Wadsworth at [Van Patten Woods](https://www.lcfpd.org/van-patten-woods/) to its southern terminus in River Grove’s [Sunset Bridge Meadow](http://fpdcc.com/location/sunset-bridge-meadow/).

The section closest to the Cumberland Blue Line stop is popular not only for its convenient location, but also for its soft dirt trails that allow for low-impact running, hiking and cycling. For this type of terrain, cyclists will want to ride a hybrid or mountain bike. Bikes are allowed on the “L” except during weekday rush hour (7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m.).

**Directions:** Take the CTA Blue Line toward O’Hare International Airport and get off at the Cumberland stop. Exit onto the north ramp to get to the intersection of Cumberland Avenue and Higgins Road. Head west on Higgins for about half a mile to South Dee Road. The trail is just west of South Dee.

#### Fort Sheridan and Openlands Lakeshore preserves

_Via Metra Union Pacific North line_

Trade overcrowded beaches for solitude along the secluded shores at Fort Sheridan Forest Preserve and Openlands Lakeshore Preserve. Not only are these green spaces naturally beautiful, they have the added appeal of military history and the arts.

[Fort Sheridan Forest Preserve](https://www.lcfpd.org/fort-sheridan/), a former U.S. Army base that operated between 1887 until 1993, has nearly 5 miles of hiking trails spread across its 250 acres of rolling terrain.

The Lake Forest fort’s story is told through self-guided educational exhibits peppered throughout the grounds, which recently underwent a $1.9 million improvement project. Trails zigzag across glacial ravines, Illinois prairie grassland and oak woodlands. The Fort Sheridan Loop crosses over the 15,000-year-old, glacial-carved Janes Ravine through woodlands and grassy savanna, and [splinters off at the trail’s eastern edge to a 70-foot overlook](http://www.lcfpd.org/assets/1/7/media_pub_30394.pdf) above the lake. The sandy shore is a prime place to spot birds migrating along the Lake Michigan flyway.

Tucked away on the edge of Fort Sheridan is another gem: [Openlands Lakeshore Preserve](https://www.openlands.org/land-and-water/openlands-lakeshore-preserve/), a 77-acre conservation area stocked with prairie grasses, endangered plant species, a small beach and big, bluff-top views of the lake. It’s home to one of the last remaining ravine and bluff ecosystems in the metropolitan region.

These vulnerable landforms provide a natural backdrop to sculptures and murals created by local artists. The nearly three-fourths-mile Bartlett Ravine Trail makes for a smooth path down to the shoreline. Along the way you’ll see a massive mural of paint, tile and metal titled “Arc of Nature.” Hikers can walk along the 1.1-mile Hamill Family Upland Trail for an elevated view of the lake. Keep an eye out for a trio of 12-foot-tall aluminum poles sporting the color hues of Lake Michigan and surrounding foliage.

**Directions:** Take [Metra’s Union Pacific North](https://metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-N) toward Kenosha out of [Ogilvie Transportation Center](https://metrarail.com/node/915). Exit at Fort Sheridan Metra Station and enter Fort Sheridan Forest Preserve on the east side of Sheridan Road.

#### LaBagh Woods and the North Branch Trail

_Via CTA 54 Cicero bus_

Known for its stellar bird-viewing opportunities, [LaBagh Woods](http://fpdcc.com/labagh-woods/) on the city’s Northwest Side offers visitors their pick of picnicking fields, miles of bike trails and chart-your-own hiking adventures under tall oaks, maples and cottonwoods. Because there’s not a main loop or labeled trails, people can plot their own course by zigzagging along short, single-track trails throughout LaBagh and around the North Branch of the Chicago River. A shallow lake, or slough, at the heart of the preserve attracts nesting Cooper’s hawks and red-tailed hawks as well as heron. White-tailed deer graze here in the spring when the wildflower-filled forests are in full bloom.

Rack up some miles on your bike with a spin on the paved [North Branch Trail](http://fpdcc.com/downloads/maps/pdf/nbn_trailmap.pdf) that starts in LaBagh Woods and travels a little over 20 miles up to the [Chicago Botanic Garden](https://www.chicagobotanic.org/) in Glencoe. Bring a bike lock: As a cyclist, you won’t have to pay the parking fee at the garden, and admission is free. The spacious cafe is a good place to replenish those calories before the return trip.

**Directions:** Take the CTA Blue Line to the Montrose stop. Turn right on Montrose Avenue to Cicero Avenue, and pick up the [54 Cicero bus](https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/ctamap_SystemMap.pdf) to ride north for six stops. (All CTA buses are equipped with [bike racks](https://www.transitchicago.com/howto/bring-your-bike-bus/).) Exit at the Cicero and Berwyn intersection and LaBagh Woods will be on the east side of Cicero.
